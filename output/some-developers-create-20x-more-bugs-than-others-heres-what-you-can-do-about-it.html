    <p>Over the last year I've been on a mission to discover new ways of improving ROI for development teams. 
As part of my work on predicting the probability of a bug in a commit, I've been analysing some large projects and using the data to train ML models.
One of the most striking things I've found is something that people on a development team will inuitively know, but something we rarely measure. 
The difference between the number of bugs individual developers create?
It's the elephant in many team rooms, which is a shame because it's one of the largest causes of slow delivery, missed deadlines and unhappy customers (and it's fixable). </p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>I've analysed over 300 repositories over the last year. Here are 3 of the largest and most active. 
For each repo below I have analysed all the commits between June 2019 and June 2020 (ignoring the most recent commits where the bugs may yet to be found)
For every fix I find the source commit and logged a bug count against the committer.
I've ignored any developer who has added less than 1000 lines of code in the period as the sample size will be too small.
Here's the results:</p>
<h3>Microsoft ASP.NET Core</h3>
<p>Over the year there were 3567 commits, 1156 of these contained a bug. A total of 7905 fixes have been made on those commits.
On average, the 34 developers who contributed more than 1000 lines of code, created a bug every 58 lines of code added.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Developers create less than 1 bug every 1000 lines of code added</li>
<li>4 Developers create less than 1 bug every 500 lines of code added</li>
<li>8 Developers create more than 1 bug every 50 lines of code added</li>
<li>5 Developers create more than 1 bug every 25 lines of code added</li>
</ul>

<h3>Google Angular</h3>
<p>Over the year there were 3619 commits, 1397 of these contained a bug. A total of 6826 fixes have been made on those commits.
On average the 32 developers who contributed more than 1000 lines of code created a bug every 79 lines of code added.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Developers create less than 1 bug every 1000 lines of code added</li>
<li>5 Developers create less than 1 bug every 500 lines of code added</li>
<li>4 Developers create more than 1 bug every 50 lines of code added</li>
<li>1 Developers create more than 1 bug every 25 lines of code added</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="PR Review Image" src="/images/Angular_analysis.png"></p>
<p>It's uncanny how similar these two repo stats are. </p>
<h3>Facebook React</h3>
<p>Over the year there were 1485 commits, 616 of these contained a bug. A total of 2487 fixes have been made on those commits.
On average the 13 developers who contributed more than 1000 lines of code created a bug every 102 lines of code added.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 Developers create less than 1 bug every 1000 lines of code added</li>
<li>1 Developers create less than 1 bug every 500 lines of code added</li>
<li>1 Developers create more than 1 bug every 50 lines of code added</li>
<li>0 Developers create more than 1 bug every 25 lines of code added</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see React repo has the lowest level of bugs and the lowest variance, they are certainly do something right. 
Could it be something to do with the smaller core team?</p>
<h2>Why is there such a large variance between developers?</h2>
<p>From the figures we can see that it's common to see a 20x variance between the number of bugs created per 1000 lines of code added. We all have different strengths, 
whilst we might excel at finding creative solution to tricky problems, we might be less good at writing tests or overcoming an urge to just get it done. 
Experienced developers often gain this intuition with experience, particularly if they are in an environment where they are free of organisational pressure. 
Organisational structure, culture and size is likely to be one of the main contributors to variance between repos something outlined <a href="https://augustl.com/blog/2019/best_bug_predictor_is_organizational_complexity/">here</a> (Thanks Gareth ;-))</p>
<h2>Why don't we collect and share these stats?</h2>
<p>We all want to create safe environments for our teams.
These stats are emotive and sharing them risks triggering deep insecurities.
If we focus directly on reducing the bugs we create, we may find ourselves reluctant to commit any code at all. 
Every Manager I've shown these to has asked me to make them available just to them - this makes me even more nervous!
In the rare case where leaders have managed to create a truly safe environment, sharing your stats and having an open honest dialogue about them could be the start of a big change. 
But Whose confident enough to take the risk?</p>
<h2>So what can we do?</h2>
<p>In most organisations measuring and sharing this data is likely to cause more problems than it solves, at least in the short term.
To save everyone's embarrassment we need to be able to spot these bugs before they are committed. 
We're all human and all different. When we work well as a team and collaborate on commits we can raise the bar of the team to that of the member with the lowest bug density.
Good collaboration (and a bit of process is one answer). </p>
<p>What else can we do? If we use this type of analysis to understand where the risks lie before committing, and receive a nudge to collaborate with the most appropriate person it can reduce the variance. The best teams do this intuitively. For the rest of us I've created <a href="https://www.solittlecode.com/reviewml">ReviewML</a> to help.</p>
